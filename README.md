# Auto Feed

Auto Feed is a Valheim mod that automatically feeds tameable creatures in the game with food from nearby chests. This mod is perfect for players who want to focus more on adventuring and less on the upkeep of their tamed animals. No more food on the floor!

## Features

- **Automatic Feeding**: Tameable creatures within range of a chest containing their supported food will be automatically fed.
- **Configurable Range**: You can set the radius the tameable creatures will look for containers to feed from.

## Configuration

The mod comes with two main configuration parameters:

- **Container Range**: This parameter determines the radius within which the tameable creatures will look for containers to feed from. The default value is 10 (units).
- **Enabled**: This parameter allows you to enable or disable the mod. By default, the mod is enabled.

## Installation

To install the mod, you need to have BepInEx installed in your Valheim game. Once BepInEx is installed, simply download the Auto Feed mod and place it in the BepInEx plugins folder.
